    <h1>Test Refresh Redirect Issue</h1>
    <p>This test simulates the refresh redirect issue:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>User logs in and navigates to /account page</li>
        <li>User refreshes the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)</li>
        <li>Expected: User stays on /account page</li>
        <li>Actual: User gets redirected to /login page</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Root Cause:</h2>
    <p>The UserAccount component checks authentication immediately on render, but the AuthProvider's useEffect that restores user state from localStorage runs asynchronously. This creates a race condition where isAuthenticated is false during the brief moment before user state is restored, causing an unwanted redirect.</p>
    
    <h2>Solution:</h2>
    <p>Add a loading state to AuthProvider to prevent premature authentication checks during the restoration process.</p>

        console.log('[DEBUG_LOG] Test script loaded - simulating refresh redirect issue');
        console.log('[DEBUG_LOG] Issue: UserAccount component redirects to login before AuthProvider restores user state');
        console.log('[DEBUG_LOG] Solution: Add loading state to prevent premature redirects');
